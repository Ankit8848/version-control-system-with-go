# version-control-system-with-go
a version control system (VCS) is software that helps track changes made to files over time. There are popular VCS options like Git, SVN, and Mercurial, each with their pros and cons. But they all share a core principle: recording who made what changes to a file, when, and why. This allows you to revert to previous versions if necessary.
